GameOfLife
==========

My interactive implementation of [Conway’s Game Of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), and by “interactive” I mean you can create or destroy life anytime!

Simply compile and run this app (whether on the device or simulator), click a couple cells (i.e. creating life) and then click the “Step” button.
